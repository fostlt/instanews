# Instanews by Lance
Basic website making use of the New York times API to make a news website. This is now
my second webpage.

## What I learned
```
jQuery, Gulp, JS, SASS, and CSS
```

I've started to feel a little more confident in understanding JS & jQuery. I still find it really hard, but I'm definitely understanding more.

## What I want to work on...
Understanding what will effect my webpage later on. I still don't have a good grasp on what will cause me problems later on. 

I want to learn how to properly use SASS. I didn't get to make full use of it. It seems way too helpful not to learn.

## Final Notes
I find it odd how much you can improve by the end of a project that you're working on.
Now that I'm "done" with it. I can see glaring errors in the way I did things.
